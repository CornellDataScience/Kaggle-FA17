# Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

The Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg challenge provides competitors with ~1600 training sample and ~8200 testing samples of unprocessed Sentinel-1 data. 
Each sample includes the inclination angle, HH and HV polarized bands, and a value tag (iceberg or no iceberg)

Because we hope to build a convolutional neural network to classify the data, the number of training samples severly limits the depth of the models. 
Furthermore, the given data provides many corrupted data files. For many images, no incidence angle is provided. For others, backscatter renders the image almost unreadable.

My research goals aim at addressing these two problems as we construct deeper neural network models. 

## Data Preprocessing

SAR data 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
