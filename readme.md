The goal for this Kaggle challenge is to build an algorithm that automatically identifies if a target found by remote sensing systems is a ship or iceberg. We need to analyze the shape, size and brightness of the object and its surrounding using data from two channels: HH (transmit/ receive horizontally) and HV (transmit horizontally/ receive vertically).
